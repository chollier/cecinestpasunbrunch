== Ceci n'est pas un Brunch (This is not a brunch) ==

This is a tiny Sinatra website I made using Instagram API and a jQuery Plugin called Supersized to display on a screen every Instagram picture tagged with #Lyon69. 

The main purpose of this website was to display picture taken by our reader at Lyon69.net on an event called "Ceci n'est pas un Brunch" ("This is not a brunch" which actually was).
